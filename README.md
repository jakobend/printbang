# [printbang](https://github.com/jakobend/printbang)

A modest serial transmitter for AVR MCUs in restricted circumstances.

```c
#define PRINTBANG_PORT PORTB
#define PRINTBANG_PIN PB0
#define PRINTBANG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "printbang.h"
// ...
for (int i = 0;; i++)
{
    bangln(PSTR("Hello from program space!"));
    bang(PSTR("Running for ")); bang(i, 10); bangln(PSTR(" seconds."));
    _delay_ms(1000);
}
```

## Why?

For AVR projects where you just don't have any more leeway than a digital pin,
a few clock cycles, and a couple of flash bytes.

## How?

printbang implements a cycle-counted transmission routine that is speed-limited
by an user-defined assembly snippet. Instead of relying on a buffer like other
software serial implementations, the function is called once for every word.
This also minimizes the cycles spent in time-critical code.

## Features

- No dependency on timers or hardware UARTs/USI
- Supports 1-8 data bits, LSB- or MSB-first transmission and even/odd parity
- 250000 baud default configuration for common clock frequencies
- Basic Arduino Serial-style formatting for numeric data types
- Doesn't depend on the Arduino core or the C++ runtime
- Doesn't depend on avr-libc formatting
- State- and heapless

## Caveats

- Recursive formatting routines can result in heavy stack load for long integers
- Interrupts are masked during transmission of a word
## Documentation
### Configuration macros

#### `HAVE_PRINTBANG_CONFIG_H` ([source](printbang.h#L89))
If this macro is defined, `<printbang_config.h>` will be included before
`printbang.h`.

#### `PRINTBANG_PORT` and `PRINTBANG_PORT_IO` ([source](printbang.h#L98))
Either of these macros define the port of the pin used for serial output.

If `PRINTBANG_PORT_IO` is not defined, it will be derived from `PRINTBANG_PORT`
by subtracting the SFR memory offset from it:
```c
#define PRINTBANG_PORT PORTA
// is equivalent to
#define PRINTBANG_PORT_IO _SFR_IO_ADDR(PORTA)
```

#### `PRINTBANG_PIN` and `PRINTBANG_PIN_MASK` ([source](printbang.h#L119))
Either of these macros define the pin(s) on the chosen port to be used for
serial output.

If `PRINTBANG_PIN_MASK` is not defined, it will be derived from `PRINTBANG_PIN`
by converting it into a bit mask:
```c
#define PRINTBANG_PIN PA0
// is equivalent to
#define PRINTBANG_PIN_MASK _BV(PA0)
```

#### `PRINTBANG_DELAY` ([source](printbang.h#L141))
This macro is an inline assembly snippet that limits the speed of the
transmission routine to a particular baudrate. If it is not defined, the
following defaults are used for common clock frequencies:
- 16.5MHz: 250000 baud, 58 delay cycles, 0% deviation
- 16MHz: 250000 baud, 56 delay cycles, 0% deviation
- 8MHz: 250000 baud, 24 delay cycles, 0% deviation
- 4MHz: 250000 baud, 8 delay cycles, 0% deviation

#### `PRINTBANG_DELAY_CLOBBER` ([source](printbang.h#L189))
This macro will be used as the clobber section of the inline assembly and allows
delay snippets to clobber registers, e.g. for looping.

TODO: Use a temporary variable instead

#### `PRINTBANG_PARITY_EVEN` and `PRINTBANG_PARITY_ODD` ([source](printbang.h#L200))
If one of these macros is defined, a bit with the given parity will be appended
to every transmitted word. This functionality depends on avr-libc's
`util/parity.h`.

#### `PRINTBANG_DATA_BITS` ([source](printbang.h#L210))
This macro defines the number of data bits transmitted per word. Counting always
starts at the least significant bit; if MSB-first transmission is used, the byte
will be aligned to the left side.

```c
// Saves one bit per word but limits transmission to ASCII characters
#define PRINTBANG_DATA_BITS 7
```

#### `PRINTBANG_ORDER_MSB` ([source](printbang.h#L225))
If this macro is defined, transmission will occur in MSB-first order. Otherwise,
LSB-first order will be used.

#### `PRINTBANG_LINE_ENDING` ([source](printbang.h#L234))
This macro expands to a string literal that will be used by `bangln` to
terminate a line. It defaults to `"\r\n"`.

#### `PRINTBANG_IMPLEMENTATION` ([source](printbang.h#L243))
printbang is a *header-only* library. When including it, its functions are
declared, but only defined if this macro is set.

The recommended way of using printbang in your project involves setting
`PRINTBANG_IMPLEMENTATION` in a single source file, most commonly wherever your
main function is located. All other source files can then include `printbang.h`
without defining this macro.
### Character and string transmission

#### `void bang_char(char value)` ([source](printbang.h#L277))
Transmits a single word over the serial pin. Interrupts are masked during the
runtime of this function.

#### `void bang_str(const char *str)` ([source](printbang.h#L371))
Transmits a null-terminated string from RAM. Calling this function on a
program-space string will result in garbage being transmitted.

#### `void bang_pstr(PGM_P str)` ([source](printbang.h#L385))
Transmits a null-terminated string from program space. Calling this function on
a RAM string will result in garbage being transmitted.
### Integer and floating point transmission

#### `void bang_uint(unsigned int value, unsigned char base)` ([source](printbang.h#L427))
#### `void bang_int(int value, unsigned char base)`
Transmits `unsigned int` respectively `int` values. The passed value is
formatted in a given `base`.

#### `void bang_ulong(unsigned long value, unsigned char base)` ([source](printbang.h#L435))
#### `void bang_long(long value, unsigned char base)`
Transmits `unsigned long` respectively `long` values. The passed value is
formatted in a given `base`.

#### `void bang_ulonglong(unsigned long long value, unsigned char base` ([source](printbang.h#L443))
#### `void bang_longlong(long long value, unsigned char base)`
Transmits `unsigned long long` respectively `long long` values. The passed value
is formatted in a given `base`.

#### `void bang_float(float value, unsigned char base)` ([source](printbang.h#L453))
Transmits `float` values. The floating point formatting is very rudimentary and
will simply concatenate the number to a given number of decimal `places`. One
trailing zero is always appended.

Since `double` is an alias for `float` in avr-libc, this function should be used
for `double` values as well.

#### `void bang(...)` ([source](printbang.h#L493))
`bang` provides a simple generic wrapper to all `bang_x` functions. If C++ is
used, it is implemented as an overloaded wrapper function. If C is used, it is
implemented as a `_Generic` macro.

Because gcc doesn't disinguish between `const char *` and `const PROGMEM char *`
at compile-time, all constant strings are handled as program-space pointers by
`bang`. If you want to `bang` a constant string literal from RAM you need to
call `bang_str` directly, but consider wrapping it in `PSTR(...)` to put it
in program space instead and save memory.

#### `void bangln(...)` ([source](printbang.h#L541))
This is a macro that first calls `bang` on the passed arguments and then
`bang_pstr` on `printbang_line_ending`.
